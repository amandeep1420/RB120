  Overview: using a normal 52-card deck consisting of the 4 suits, your goal is
  to try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over; if you go over,
  it's a "bust", and you lose. 
  
  
  Card values: All face cards are worth 10 points; Aces are worth either 11 points 
  (if your current hand total + 11 is less than or equal to 21) or 1 point (if
  your current hand total + 11 is greater than 21). Ace values change depending
  on the contents of your hand; if your hand contains an Ace and you draw a card
  that pushes your total over 21, that Ace's value is automatically dropped to 1.
  
  
  Setup: the game consists of both you and "The Dealer". You both are initially
  dealt 2 cards; you're allowed to peek at one of the Dealer's cards during this
  initial deal.
  
  
  Turns: you will go first. You can decide to either "hit" or "stay"; a "hit"
  means that you will ask for another card; "stay" means that you would no longer
  like to draw cards, concluding your turn. You are able to "hit" as many times
  as you'd like, so long as you don't "bust". 
  Once your turn has concluded, the Dealer will begin their turn. The Dealer
  must keep hitting until their hand total is at least 17. If the Dealer
  busts, you automatically win.
  
  
  Conclusion: if either player has busted, then the other is automatically
  declared the winner; if neither has busted, then both players' hand totals
  are compared once they are done hitting to find the hand with the highest
  total. The player with the higher hand total is awarded a point; the winner
  of the game is whoever can reach the specified point threshold for winning
  first.
  
  
  You're up to speed - let's begin the game!

  sneaky: >
    The Dealer furtively watches you, catching a moment when you glance away;
    they then slip a card out of their sleeve, tuck it into their hand, smirk, and
    rap the table with a knuckle to signal the conclusion of their turn. You look
    back at the dealer, none the wiser.
  honest: >
    The Dealer dutifully goes about their turn after demonstrating a distinct lack
    of cards in their sleeves, pockets, gloves, hat, and moustache. You find yourself
    admiring the sheer professionalism and integrity at display. The Dealer then raps
    the table with a knuckle to signal the conclusion of their turn, and you can't
    help but feel a sense of wistfulness at the thought that you'll soon part ways.
  lazy: >
    The Dealer yawns, rubs their eyes, and goes on their phone. Another dealer walks over
    and sighs. "Again?", they say. The new Dealer sits down."Look at me; I am the Dealer
    now.", they whisper. The new Dealer (now known as "The Dealer") dutifully goes about
    their turn, rapping the table with a knuckle once they've finished. You wonder how
    the first Dealer still has a job.
  goofy: >
    The Dealer attempts to start their turn, but slips on a banana peel instead; their pants
    fly off, a coconut creme pie smashes them in the face, and they accidentally send
    $20,000,000 to a Nigerian prince. Eventually, they sort themselves out and go about
    their turn, rapping the table with a knuckle once they've finished.
    
    
    You wonder how they managed to slip on a banana peel while sitting.
  anime: >
    The Dealer stands up, assumes a power stance, and starts yelling loudly. Before you
    have a chance to question what's going on, the room starts to shake. The walls crack,
    cards start to lift off the table, and lightning roars in the distance. You notice
    the Dealer's hair and eyes flashing yellow and blue, respectively. Just when you
    start to think that the room will collapse, the Dealer finishes their yelling and
    sits back down, their hair and eyes now fully transformed. You can barely withstand
    their aura.
    
    
    The Dealer goes about their turn, rapping the table with a knuckle once they've
    finished...and breaking the table in half as a result.
